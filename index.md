# Endpoint Amsterdam
**_adding scalability to real-time open data_**

This webservice offers unified and direct access to open data from government, commercial and crowd sources alike. This open interface is adopted as standard by 6 European cities in the Project CitySDK.

A list of available data in this endpoint can be seen via [data]({{ site.baseurl }}/data) and the [map viewer]({{ site.baseurl }}/map).

## How to join?

Would your city like to open up its data and services to a big European developer community by joining CitySDK? Get in touch with the [owners]({{ site.data.endpoint.email }}) of this endpoint or the project management of CitySDK at [Forum Virium Helsinki](http://www.citysdk.eu/partners/forum-virium/).

## Project CitySDK

CitySDK is creating a toolkit for the development of digital services within cities. With open and interoperable digital service interfaces, CitySDK enables a more efficient utilisation of the expertise and know-how of developer communities.

See the [CitySDK project website](http://www.citysdk.eu/) for a comprehensive overview of the complete CitySDK toolkit.
